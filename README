pdfsplit - A Mac OS X utility to split PDF into pages
=====================================================

Why?
----

I am surprised to see there is no simple, lightweight and fast
utility to split PDF in Mac OS X. There is a Python based [1]
inplemention utilizing the Python binding of Core Graphics,
but PyObjC is traditionally very slow. So here this a direct
C translation of this tool.

How?
----

Build it with Xcode installed then type 'make'. Though I haven't
tested myself, it should support systems above Mac OS X 10.4.

usage: pdfsplit input.pdf splitPageNum1 splitPageNum2 ...

  - input.pdf: the path to the input pdf file.

  - splitPageNum1, ...: each one is a positive integer; the numbers
    must not exceed the number of pages of the input file, and the
    entire sequence must be strictly increasing.

Example: splitPDF input.pdf 3 5

This will split file input.pdf into 3 files (assuming input.pdf is 10
pages long):

  - input.1-3.pdf contains page 1-3;
  - input.4-5.pdf contains page 4-5;
  - input.6-10.pdf contains page 6-10.
